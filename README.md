**Semester project for subject `Orchestration Tools for Containers`.**

## What will you find here
- OpenStack deployment via `Terraform`
- Kubernetes cluster installation with a <sup>little</sup> help from `Minikube`
- Containerized FE/BE application with none other than `Docker` itself  
- FE/BE `Helm` charts, so you can overtemplate the templated template.
- and `Tekton` CI/CD pipelines for building/pushing to DockerHub and (re)deploying the charts.
